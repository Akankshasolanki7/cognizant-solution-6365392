# 🎯 4-Week Development Plan (Week 4-7)

## 📋 Overview
Systematic development of 4 weeks with incremental Git pushes.

## 🗓️ Week-by-Week Development Strategy

### **Current Status:**
- ✅ **Week 1**: Complete (Algorithms, Design Patterns)
- ✅ **Week 2**: Complete (SQL, NUnit, MOQ)
- ✅ **Week 3**: Complete (Entity Framework Core)
- 🔄 **Week 4-7**: Incremental development

### **� Development Phases:**

#### **Phase 1: Week 4**
```bash
# Step 1: Setup
git add "Week 4/"
git commit -m "Week 4: Initial setup"
git push origin main

# Step 2: Each exercise

git push origin main

# Step 3: Week completion
git commit -m "Week 4: Complete all exercises"
git push origin main
```

#### **Phase 2: Week 5**
```bash
git commit -m "Week 5: Initial setup"
git push origin main
# ... continue pattern

```bash
git commit -m "Week 6: Initial setup"
git push origin main
# ... continue pattern
```

git push origin main
# ... continue pattern
```
