## ðŸ”„ React Component Lifecycle Objectives

This section focuses on understanding the **lifecycle** of a React component â€” what happens from creation to removal â€” and why it matters.

### âœ… Learning Objectives

- **Explain the Need and Benefits of Component Lifecycle**  
  React's component lifecycle helps you control how and when a component is created, updated, and destroyed. It allows developers to:
  - Perform actions at specific stages (e.g., fetch data after mount)
  - Optimize rendering and performance
  - Clean up resources like timers or subscriptions
  - Debug component behavior effectively

- **Identify Various Lifecycle Hook Methods**  
  React provides several lifecycle methods (for class components) and hooks (for function components) to manage different phases:
  
  **Class Components:**
  - `constructor()` â€“ Initialization
  - `render()` â€“ Rendering the UI
  - `componentDidMount()` â€“ After component is added to the DOM
  - `componentDidUpdate()` â€“ After updates
  - `componentWillUnmount()` â€“ Before removal

  **Function Components (via Hooks):**
  - `useEffect()` â€“ Acts like `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` combined depending on dependencies

- **List the Sequence of Steps in Rendering a Component**  
  Here is the typical sequence in **class components**:
  
  1. **constructor()** â€“ Set initial state and bindings
  2. **render()** â€“ Returns the JSX to render
  3. **componentDidMount()** â€“ Called once the component is mounted
  4. **componentDidUpdate()** â€“ Called after state or props change
  5. **componentWillUnmount()** â€“ Cleanup before the component is removed

  In **function components**, `useEffect()` with appropriate dependencies handles these stages.
